    <ul>
        <li>Learning new things</li>
        <li>Exploring World</li>
        <li>Helping others</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="black-border">By applying these principles I try to enjoy the life to the fullest, learning new things especially tech related and acquiring new skills 
        on several fields for personal growth. Traveling to different places gives me the opportunity to explore the world and see the beauty of different cultures, 
        traditions, history and nature, this also aids to escape hustle and bustle of daily life where my mind and body comes at rest. Helping others gives me inner 
        peace and gratification, a goal in life and moral obligation to care for less fortunate.
    <br>
    <br>
        My Personal believe is to have zest for life you need to be grateful for small things and appreciate every blessing life provides.
