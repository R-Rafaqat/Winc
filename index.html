<h1>Human Body</h1>
<h2>Cells</h2>
  <p>The body contains trillions of cells, the fundamental unit of life. At maturity, there are roughly 30-37 trillion cells in the body, an estimate arrived at by totaling the cell 
    numbers of all the organs of the body and cell types. The body is also host to about the same number of non-human cells as well as multicellular organisms which reside in the 
    gastrointestinal tract and on the skin. Not all parts of the body are made from cells. Cells sit in an extracellular matrix that consists of proteins such as collagen, surrounded by 
    extracellular fluids. Of the 70 kg (150 lb) weight of an average human body, nearly 25 kg (55 lb) is non-human cells or non-cellular material such as bone and connective tissue.</p>
  <p>Cells in the body function because of DNA. DNA sits within the nucleus of a cell. Here, parts of DNA are copied and sent to the
    body of the cell via RNA. The RNA is then used to create proteins which form the basis for cells, their activity, and their products.
    Proteins dictate cell function and gene expression, a cell is able to self-regulate by the amount of proteins produced. However, 
    not all cells have DNA; some cells such as mature red blood cells lose their nucleus as they mature.

<h2>Tissues</h2>
  <p>The body consists of many different types of tissue, defined as cells that act with a specialised function. The study of tissues is called 
    histology and often occurs with a microscope. The body consists of four main types of tissues. These are lining cells (epithelia), connective
    tissue, nerve tissue and muscle tissue</p>
  <p>Cells that lie on surfaces exposed to the outside world or gastrointestinal tract (epithelia) or internal cavities (endothelium) 
    come in numerous shapes and forms, from single layers of flat cells, to cells with small beating hair-like cilia in the lungs, to column-like cells that line the stomach.
     Endothelial cells are cells that line internal cavities including blood vessels and glands. Lining cells regulate what can and can't pass through them, protect internal structures, 
     and function as sensory surfaces</p>
<h2>Organs</h2>
  <p>Organs, structured collections of cells with a specific function, mostly sit within the body, with the exception of skin. 
    Examples include the heart, lungs and liver. Many organs reside within cavities within the body. These cavities include the abdomen
    (which contains the stomach, for example) and pleura, which contains the lungs</p>
  <p>The heart is an organ located in the thoracic cavity between the lungs and slightly to the left. It is surrounded by the pericardium which holds it in place in the mediastinum and 
      serves to protect it from blunt trauma, infection and help lubricate the movement of the heart via pericardial fluid. The heart works by pumping blood around the body allowing 
      oxygen, nutrients, waste, hormones and white blood cells to be transported.</p>
